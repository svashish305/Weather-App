```
Add required node-modules using package.json by typing: npm install
Clone the repository in your local directory 
and open terminal/cmd in that directory 
and type npm install

For help:
node app-promise.js -h 
To run, 
default location is given as of Hyderabad. 
If you wish to look for any region, 
add the ZIP code by using -a (address)
or full address as string in quotes, for eg. :
node app-promise.js -a 700091

If result is undefined, 
rerun as this may happen due to internet connectivity issues. 
Once the result comes, 
you can see the full location, 
temperature, current weather stats,
the day's forecast as well as weekly forecast.
